# Ai PreMidsem Lab Reports

- AI Lab repository group name : OpenAI.

### Index : 

> - There are 4 lab reports:
		> - 1. Week 1 : To design a graph search agent and understand the use of a hash table, queue in state space search.
		> - 2. Week 2 : To understand the use of Heuristic function for reducing the size of the search space.  Explore non-classical search algorithms for large problems.
		> - 3. Week 3 : Non-deterministic Search | Simulated Annealing
For problems with large search spaces, randomized search becomes a meaningful option given partial/ full-information about the domain.  
		> - 4. Week 5 : Game Playing Agent | Minimax | Alpha-Beta Pruning Systematic adversarial search can lead to savings in terms of pruning of sub-trees resulting in lesser node evaluations
